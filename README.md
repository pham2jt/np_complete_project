# np_complete_project
# minimum vertex cover: the mininmum number of vertices that includes an endpoint of every edge in the graph
# Decision problem: is there a number of vertices, n, that includes an endpoint of every edge?
# NP - Complete checking: Check every edge to make sure that a vertex is included.
